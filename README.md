### Recommended Working Format

After problems are identified, pick one where you can offer expertise or extensive personal experience, and form a group of 3-4 others who feel the same. In your working group, identify one person who will be the "Synthesizer / Scribe" who will from the very beginning of the work be responsible for writing a well-formatted narrative or clean outline of the content you'd like to publish/share by the end of the sprint. 

### Project Team Accomplishments
After some initial conversation and [brainstorming](doc/InitialTopicBrainstorm.md), the group decided to choose two topics and split into one subgroup for each topic.

The __Duplicates__ subgroup started a [catalog of matching and duplicate rules for common use cases](doc/SampleDuplicateRules.md).

Duplicate solutions - completed but lacking links in Github: Videos, including one on flows

The __Addresses__ subgroup started documenting methods for ensuring address standardization and completeness, including a comparison of NPSP-compatible tools (https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Data-Integrity-Integrations/wiki/Documentation:-Data-Integrity-Issues-related-to-Address-data). 


# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams

### Project Team Accomplishments
After some initial conversation we started to discuss over the Duplicate Management pickles with multiple entries of integration we started [documenting some of the issues found](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Data-Integrity-Integrations/blob/120fb980a4632e2933a64f76e10ff740ecc45215/doc/SPRINT29thJune-Brainstorming).

The team had a range of experience including non profit end users who are working through data integrity problems that they have inherited and consultants who advise non profits on how to design integrations to ensure data integrity. We reviewed the materials created in the last sprint and did not identify any obvious areas of contibution to those so focused on creating a document that provides guidance to admins on how to approach integration design to avoid data integrity problems and how to work through data integration that arise through integration. 

Find the updated [Wiki here](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Data-Integrity-Integrations/wiki) and continue in future sprints to extend and organise all entries in a easy to consume structure

# Project Resources and Documentation
* Documentation can be found in the repository links under accomplishments and in the wiki site https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Data-Integrity-Integrations/wiki
* Power of Us HUB group "Sprint Project: Data Integrity Issues": https://powerofus.force.com/s/group/0F97y00000009hdCAA/sprint-data-issues-with-integatrations


# Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Next steps for future sprnts:
* Data Integrity issues related to duplicates: Add the "what" and the "why" and make the documentation more useable so integrations can be managed better
* Data Integrity issues releated to addresses: Complete documention by expanding and refining it, continue testing tools and solutions such as Google MAPS, and review all NPSP integration options
* Find the updated [Wiki here](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Data-Integrity-Integrations/wiki) and continue in future sprints to extend and organise all entries in a easy to consume structure
